                    <p>
                        Smjh nhi a rha kaha se start kru because jab bhi apke baare sochta hu my heart just gets heavy,
                        heavy in the sweetest way, heavy with love, heavy with feelings, heavy with kind of attachment
                        that I never knew that I could have for someone. And honestly sometimes it scares me kyunki aap
                        sirf mere life ke part nhi ho, you are my life🥺🫂.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Apko pata hai people celebrate Valentine Day with chocolates, flowers, dates but mere liye
                        Valentine Day bs ek bahana hai apko ek baar firse yaad dilaye ki I am yours, Fully, Only and
                        Madly Yours🫵🫵
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Even though abhi hum dur hai🥺, even though I can't hold your hand right now, even though I
                        can't pull you close and kiss your forehead, still, aise lgta hai jaise my heart lives next to
                        you. Jaise ki my soul has already chosen its home💝. you're not just my girlfriend, you're my
                        comfort, you are my peace, you are the most beautiful habit of my heart😌
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mujhe pata hai mai kai baar ache se nhi bol pata, I dont always say it perfectly, I know
                        sometimes I might not express everything the way you deserve, the way I actually feel, but
                        believe one thing that my love for you is real. Its deep. Its pure, its unending, its forever
                        and ever. Its the kind of love that doesnt fade with time, it grows💗
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Apko nhi pata apka kya effect hai mere pe, Apki awaz akele hi mera mood sahi kr deti hai, apke
                        random msgs, random love you, random affections just make my day sooooo much better. Apki
                        presence even through the screen, makes me feel like everything is good. You dont even
                        understand what you do to me. Its like mai normally act kr raha hota hu and you send me a cute
                        "baby" msg and fir I am just smiling like an idiot like I've lost my mind, vaise wo to apko
                        dekhte hi lost ho gya tha ji🤭
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Babyy you know what, being yours is my favourite feeling. I love you in a way that doesnt depend
                        on distance. I love you in a way that is not temporary. I love you in a way that doesnt need a
                        reason, I love in a way that I just want to eat you🤭😁
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And honestly, I dont want a valentine. I want you, not for a day, not for one month, not for one
                        year. I want you for every season of my life. I want to be the man who protects you when you're
                        weak, who makes you laugh when you're stressed, who holds you when you feel like crying, who
                        listens to your cute si daant when I make you angry🤭, who reminds you every single day that you
                        are loved beyond words❤️🫂
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I want to be the person jiske sath aap safe feel kro. The person jiske sath aap childish ho
                        sako. The person jiske sath aap angry ho sako, the person jiske sath aap silent ho sako. Kyunki
                        real love isnt just romance its comfort, and myy babyy is like my home🥹🫂
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You are the softest part of my heart. The prettiest reflection in my mind. the most special
                        prayer on my lips, the most tastiest thought in my imagination🤭.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I wish ki abhi mai apke sath hota to look into your eyes, hold your cheeks, and tell you how
                        much I love you🥹. I wish ki mai apko zorrr se hug kr pata that all your stress, pain, and
                        overthinking disappears. I wish ki I could kiss your forehead and say, 'I am here, my baby,
                        always🥹🫂' But jab tak wo din nhi ata keep this msg close to you, kyunki every word here is
                        real.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I dont just love you when things are easy. I love you when things are hard. I love you even when
                        we fight. I love you even when we dont talk for a while. I love you even when you are angry at
                        me. I dont love your mood, I love youu🥺🫵. And no matter what happens. no matter what life
                        brings, no matter how far the distance is I will always try for you. I will always improve for
                        you. I will always stand for you. Kyunki aap mere life me temporary chapter nhi ho you are my
                        whole story🥹🫂
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I want to make you feel loved in every way possible. I want to love you so deeply that you never
                        doubt your worth. I want to make you feel like the most special girl in the world, because to me
                        you really are one. You are the girl jiske liye my heart prayed for without knowing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I love your smile<br>
                        I love your attitude🤭<br>
                        I love your cuteness<br>
                        I love the way you get mad<br>
                        I love the way you care<br>
                        I love you tasty sa nose😋<br>
                        I love the way you exist
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And yes, I even love the way you steal my peace because you replace it with fun and
                        happiness🤭😁. If love was a language you would be the only sentence I would ever want to speak.
                    </p>

                    <p>
